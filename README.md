## Project Goals
We have decided to answer the following questions:
1. Find **the most dangerous** terrorist in the graph
2. Detect **the most cohesive groups** of terrorists
3. Detect **the most influencial** terrorist within each group
4. How do the partitions change after we delete the leader of each group?
